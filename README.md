```python
import python.rcp_

SymbolLibrary = python.rcp_.PythonRCPSymbols

print(SymbolLibrary.rcp_printercommand) # Will Print "printer"

print(SymbolLibrary.rcp_rcpcolor) # Returns "color"

# And so on... so forth...
```
With the Keywords and Tools provided, You can create certain runtimes for RCP using The STDIN And STDOUT Features.

## Using Quick / Quickfiles
QuickFiles are simple, Low memory, Base Files created to help ease Rapid production of applications using the `quick` Command via Terminal/Executable.

This Installation/Version of RCP Comes with a Quick Executable Pre-Installed. So your Command Should be...
```
"diff\quick.exe"
```
Make sure to run it in the Same directory As the RCP executable. This Fires the [Quickfile](Quickfile).
